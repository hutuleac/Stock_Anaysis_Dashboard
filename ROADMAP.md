# Roadmap — Indicators & Features

Target trade style: medium-term positions (2 months – 1 year), large cap growth + mid/small cap.
Two planned views: **Momentum / Trend Following** and **Pullback / Mean Reversion**.

## Shipped

- ✅ **v0.10 — Weekly Setup Signals** (`signals.js`): a leading-signal layer adapted from the range-finder crypto project. Two separately-scored weekly setups — **Pullback/Accumulation** (RSI divergence + downtrend exhaustion + volume dry-up + range position) and **Momentum/Breakout** (BB squeeze + structure breakout + volume expansion + EMA reclaim) — each with readiness (WATCH/SOON/ACT) and ETA. This is the first concrete implementation of the two-view (Momentum / Pullback) concept below. Covers roadmap item **#6 Volume dry-up** and overlaps **#5 BB+RSI confluence**. Zero new API calls.
- ✅ **v0.11 — Relative Strength + growth valuation** (items **#3, #10, #11**): RS vs SPY (1M/3M) via `computeRelativeStrength` (SPY closes fetched once/refresh); Revenue growth + P/S + PEG (`valuation.js` + Finnhub metrics). Display-only — Fundamentals Bar cells with tooltips + an RS chip on watchlist rows. No scoring changes.
- ✅ **v0.12 — Free signal batch** (items **#1, #5, #7, #8**): EMA Stack (`computeEmaStack` → BULL STACK / PARTIAL / BROKEN chip), Oversold Confluence (`computeOversoldConfluence` → RSI<35 + lower-BB badge), ROC 20d/60d (`priceReturn` → momentum cell), and 52w-high proximity (`proximityTo52wHigh` → "AT HIGH" / "x% ↓ 52wH" chip, using the Finnhub `52WeekHigh` metric for consistency with the 52w bar). All computed in `computeIndicatorsFromCandles` (except 52w, at display) — zero new API calls, display-only (no `computeScore`/setups changes), with tooltips. **Deferred:** #8's volume-confirmation overlay (proximity-only for now).

## Priority queue

### 1. EMA Stack signal ✅ v0.12
- Condition: price > EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200 = full bull alignment
- All four values already computed in `indicators.js` — just needs a combined chip display
- Output: `BULL STACK` / `PARTIAL` / `BROKEN` badge on each ticker row
- Zero new API calls. ~1 hour to implement.
- **Shipped** as `computeEmaStack` (`indicators.js`); BULL STACK / BROKEN chip on watchlist rows (PARTIAL hidden as noise)

### 2. ATR-based stop + Risk/Reward ✅ v0.12
- ATR already computed in `computeWeeklyTrend` (indicators.js) but never surfaced to UI
- Formula: suggested stop = entry − 2×ATR; R:R = (analyst target − entry) / (entry − stop)
- Surface in Pullback view and EntryPanel
- Feeds into position sizing once account size is stored in Settings
- **Shipped** — EntryPanel now shows a suggested stop (entry − 2× **weekly** ATR from `data.weekly.atr`; weekly chosen over daily so the stop isn't inside the noise on a 2mo–1yr hold) + R:R to analyst target ((target − entry) / (entry − stop), keying off the manual stop when set, else the suggested stop; guarded for no-upside/inverted-stop). The pre-existing daily-ATR band is a separate stop-too-tight check, left as-is.
- **Cleanup done in this change:** `computeIndicatorsFromCandles` now exposes daily `atr`, and EntryPanel reads `data.indicators.atr` for the stop-too-tight band instead of making its own daily `fetchCandles` + duplicating `computeATR`. Drops one Finnhub call per ticker — matters on a static GitHub Pages deploy (no backend) against the free-tier rate limit.

### 3. Relative Strength vs SPY (1M / 3M) ✅ v0.11
- Stock's return vs SPY over 1 and 3 months
- SPY quote already fetched in market context — need to track its 1M/3M return
- Core signal for trend following: outperforming the index = institutional buying
- Compute from existing candle data, no new API calls
- **Shipped** as `computeRelativeStrength` (`indicators.js`); SPY daily closes fetched once/refresh, RS chip on rows + Fundamentals Bar cell

### 4. OBV (On-Balance Volume)
- Free computation from existing OHLCV candle data
- OBV rising while price consolidates = accumulation
- OBV falling while price holds = distribution warning
- Add to `computeIndicatorsFromCandles` in `indicators.js`

### 5. BB + RSI combo signal ✅ v0.12
- RSI < 35 AND price near BB lower band = high-conviction oversold entry
- Both values already computed — needs a combined signal field in `indicators.js`
- Show as a single "Oversold Confluence" badge in Pullback view
- No new data required
- **Shipped** as `computeOversoldConfluence` (`indicators.js`); OVERSOLD confluence badge in FundamentalsBar (RSI<35 + price ≤ lower band +2%)

### 6. Volume dry-up detection ✅ v0.10
- 5-day avg volume < 50% of 20-day avg = selling exhaustion
- Price holding + volume collapsing = classic mean-reversion setup
- Compute from existing candle `v` array
- **Shipped** as `detectVolumeProfile` in `signals.js` (weekly DRY_UP / EXPANSION states), feeding both setup scores

### 7. Rate of Change (ROC 20d / 60d) ✅ v0.12
- Shows momentum acceleration/deceleration
- 20d ROC rising while 60d is flat = early trend emergence
- Compute from candle closes in `indicators.js`, zero API cost
- **Shipped** — `roc20`/`roc60` (via `priceReturn`) in `computeIndicatorsFromCandles`; ROC cell in FundamentalsBar with accel/decel tooltip

### 8. 52-week high proximity alert ✅ v0.12 (proximity only)
- < 3% from 52-week high = breakout watch signal
- Already display 52w bar — add a flag/chip when within striking distance
- Combine with volume confirmation (above-average volume = stronger signal)
- **Shipped** as `proximityTo52wHigh` (`indicators.js`); chip on watchlist rows ("AT HIGH" / "x% ↓ 52wH") using the Finnhub `52WeekHigh` metric. **Volume-confirmation overlay still TODO.**

### 9. Short interest
- Finnhub endpoint: `/stock/short-interest`
- High short % + improving fundamentals = potential squeeze setup
- Especially relevant for mid/small cap picks
- Add to `finnhub.svelte.js`, display alongside insider transactions

### 10. Revenue growth YoY + P/S ratio ✅ v0.11
- Revenue growth already available in Finnhub metrics — just not displayed
- P/S = market cap / revenue (both available)
- Critical for growth stocks where P/E is misleading or negative
- Add to FundamentalsBar
- **Shipped** — `revenueGrowthTTMYoy` + `psTTM` as Fundamentals Bar cells with tooltips

### 11. PEG ratio ✅ v0.11
- PEG = P/E ÷ EPS growth rate
- Both inputs already fetched from Finnhub metrics
- PEG < 1 = undervalued relative to growth; > 2 = expensive
- Compute client-side, display in FundamentalsBar alongside P/E
- **Shipped** as `computePEG` (`valuation.js`); null-guarded for zero/negative growth and non-positive P/E

### 12. Beta
- Available in Finnhub metrics (`beta`)
- Feeds volatility-adjusted position sizing suggestion
- High beta + wide ATR = smaller position; surface a simple size suggestion
- Requires one-time account size input in Settings

### 13. Swing low support levels
- Auto-detect last 3 significant lows from daily candle data
- Classic mean-reversion entry anchor: price returning to prior support
- Compute in `indicators.js` from existing candle array

## Two-view architecture

**Option A — Toggle on WatchlistTable columns**
- Momentum columns: EMA stack, RS vs SPY, OBV trend, ROC, proximity to 52w high
- Pullback columns: BB+RSI combo, volume dry-up, ATR stop suggestion, distance from recent high

**Option B — Separate tabs in detail panel (FundamentalsBar area)**
- "Trend Setup" tab: RS vs SPY, OBV, ROC 20d/60d, EMA stack, breakout proximity
- "Pullback Setup" tab: BB+RSI confluence, ATR stop/target, swing lows, volume dry-up

Option B is preferred — keeps the watchlist table scannable and puts depth in the detail view.
